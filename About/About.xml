	<description>I wanted a more space-efficient, high-tech way of getting rid of excess heat, so I made this.  It transfers heat to a pocket dimension where you'll never have to worry about entropy again -- but it does so at the expensive expense of advanced components and a considerable amount of power.  As such, it's best suited for already started reactors.
